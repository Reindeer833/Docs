                CPP streams hierarchy
                =====================

In C++ stream is an abstraction which represents device on which io operations are performed.
Stream is linked to a file through open operation and disassociated through close operation
Files/devices may be different but streams are the same.


Manipulators
------------
Manipulators are global functions designed to be used together with insertion (<<) and extraction (>>) operators performed on iostream stream objects
