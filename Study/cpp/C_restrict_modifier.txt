			   =================
						   
In the C programming language, restrict is a keyword that can be used in pointer declarations. 
By adding this type qualifier, a programmer hints to the compiler that for the lifetime of the pointer, 
no other pointer will be used to access the object to which it points. 
This allows the compiler to make optimizations (for example, vectorization) 
that would not otherwise have been possible.
