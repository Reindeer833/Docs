                      ======================
						   

Two types of associative containers:
------------------------------------

    AssociativeContainer, which represents an ordered container utilizing key-based lookup
    UnorderedAssociativeContainer, which utilizes hashing for key-based lookup


The ordered associative containers are:
---------------------------------------

    std::set, which implements a collection of unique keys, sorted by keys
    std::map, which implements a collection of key-value pairs, sorted by unique keys
    std::multiset, which implements a set that allows multiple entries each key
    std::multimap, which implements a map that allows multiple entries for each key


The unordered associative containers are:
-----------------------------------------

    std::unordered_set: Collection of unique keys, hashed by key
    std::unordered_map: Collection of key-value pairs, hashed by unique keys
    std::unordered_multiset: Unordered set that allows multiple entries for each key
    std::unordered_multimap: Unordered map that allows multiple entries for each key
