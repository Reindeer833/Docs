                CPP weak_ptr
                ============
	
shared_ptr<T>   templated class

Must be initialized by a shared_ptr

shared_ptr<int> aaa(10);
weak_ptr<int> wp(aaa);

weak_ptr<T> cannot be used directly.  Function lock will return 
shared_ptr and this shared_ptr can be used.  We have to
check if this shared_ptr is still valid.

if(shared_ptr<int> spi = wp.lock() ){

//   do something with spi

}
