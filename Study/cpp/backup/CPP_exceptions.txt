                ==============


try(){


	throw(myException);//Statements after this one are NOT executed

}catch(int ii){

}catch(string stR){

}catch(MyExceptionClas mec){

}catch(...){


}

Notes:
------
... catches all exceptions

If exception of derived class is thrown but base class handler precedes derived
class handler then base class handler is used.


Division be zero cannot be caught in C++
Stroustrup says, in "The Design and Evolution of C++" (Addison Wesley, 1994), 
"low-level events, such as arithmetic overflows and divide by zero, are assumed 
to be handled by a dedicated lower-level mechanism rather than by exceptions. "
