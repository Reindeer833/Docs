                           =================


virtual function is preceded by keyword virtual in a definition of base class.  Virtual function expects to be overridden 
in derived class.

The keyword virtual may be used ONLY in class declaration.
virtual function is a non-static member function

virtual void foo()=0;
Pure virtual function.  Class with pure virtual function
cannot be instantiated.

In derived class I do not need to use keyword virtual but I can
follow function declaration with word:  override

If I have pointer or reference to a base class
and I assign this reference to a derived class,
then overridden derived class virtual function will be called.

In C++ dynamic or run-time binding happens when I call virtual function
using base clase pointer or reference.

If I call non-virtual function using base class pointer or reference bound to
derived class, base class function will be called.
