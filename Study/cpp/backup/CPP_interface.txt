                           =========
						   


In *.cpp interface is realized as abstract class

A class is made abstract by declaring at least one of its functions as pure virtual function (PVF). 
A pure virtual function is specified by placing "= 0"

// pure virtual function
      virtual double getVolume() = 0;

Reason for PVF is to provide an appropriate base class from which other classes can inherit. 
Interfaces can NOT be instantiated.

Classes which can be instantiated are called concrete classes.
