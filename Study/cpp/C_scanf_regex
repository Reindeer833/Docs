                           scanf with regex
			   ================
						   

#include <stdio.h>

scanf has some limited regex capabilities when using char classes.
Example:
--------
char buffer[128];
printf("\n\nEnter your wisdom:  ");
scanf("%127[a-z,A-Z, ,  ,1-9]+s",buffer);
printf("\nYou've entered: %s  ",buffer);

This will allow you to enter text with spaces.
But scanf will stop scanning input as soon as you enter a char
which is not among those in char classes.
