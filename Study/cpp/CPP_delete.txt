                CPP delete
                ==========

void foo()  delete;

A deleted function is the one which is declared but may not be used.

We can declare copy constructor as deleted to prevent copies.
We can declare copy assignment operator = as deleted to prevent copies.

		

Class with private constructor still can be constructed if there is a static function calling this constructor.
Class with deleted constructor can NOT be constructed.


Cannot be copied
----------------
struct noncopyable
{
  noncopyable() =default;
  noncopyable(const noncopyable&) =delete;
  noncopyable& operator=(const noncopyable&) =delete;
};
