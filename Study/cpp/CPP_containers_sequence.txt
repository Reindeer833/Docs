                      ===================
						   

Sequence containers: 
-------------------
array
vector
list
forward_list
deque. 

Each of these containers implements different storage algorithms ===> that they have 
different speed for different operations

array:         Implements a compile-time non-resizable array.
vector:        Implements an array with fast random access 
               and an ability to automatically resize when appending elements.
deque:         Implements a double-ended queue with comparatively fast random access.
list:          Implements a doubly linked list.
forward_list:  Implements a singly linked list.


Usage:
------

array, vector and deque: They support fast random access to the element

list:          Supports bidirectional iteration 
               Supports in the middle insertin

forward_list:  Supports only one direction iteration
