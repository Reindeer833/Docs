                ==============
						   
const_cast<target>(expr)  performs a cast of pointer or references 
                          which is declared as pointing referencing const obj
                          but this object must not be constant.

const_cast is used to remove the const-ness from references and pointers that ultimately refer to something that is not const.
                  

    int xxx=10;
    const int* ptr=&xxx;
    cout<<"Before cast: "<<xxx<<endl;
    int* pXxx=const_cast<int*>(ptr);
    *pXxx=100;
    cout<<"After cast: "<<xxx<< endl << endl;

/*
Before cast: 10
After  cast: 100

*/



    int yyy=20;
    const int& ryyy=yyy;
    cout<<"Before cast: "<<yyy<<endl;
    int& rzzz = const_cast<int&>(ryyy);
    rzzz=200;
    cout<<"After cast: "<<yyy<<endl;


/*
Before cast: 20
After cast:  200

*/
