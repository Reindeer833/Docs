                DELETE KEYWORD
                ==============
	
To declare a function as a deleted function we append the =delete
 specifier to the end of that function **declaration.**
 The compiler disables the usage of a deleted function. 
 
 class CL{
 	public:
 		CL() = delete;                      //preventing default constructor
 		CL(const CL&) = delete;             //preventing copying
 		CL& operator=(const CL&) = delete;  //preventing assignment
 
 
 
 };
