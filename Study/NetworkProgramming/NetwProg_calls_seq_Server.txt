			Sequence of Server Calls
                        ========================


1.   socket(...)      --  will return socket descriptor on success
2.   bind(...)        --  bind to the local address and to a port
                          bind() will fail if the port is already bound
3.   listen(...)      --  set the socket so it will listen for incoming connections
                          Before the call to listen any incoming connection request 
                          to the socket address will be rejected.
4.   accept(...)      --  wait for a client to connect. Blocking.

Now use socket handle returned from accept(...) to recv(...) message from client 
                                             or to send(...) messages to client
