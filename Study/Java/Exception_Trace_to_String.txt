				EXCEPTION TRACE TO STRING
				=========================





Throwable:   public void printStackTrace(PrintWriter s)
----------


PrintWriter prints formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream
-----------

PrintWriter can print to File, OutputStream, Writer
   depending on constructor, say:  PrintWriter(File file)      PrintWriter(Writer wr);


StringWriter collects its output in a buffer
------------
I can get this buffer:  public StringBuffer getBuffer()




Joining all these features
--------------------------



StringWriter stw = new StringWriter();
PrintWriter  pwr = new PrintWriter(stw);
Throwable:   printStackTrace(pwr);


Now I have exception stack trace in StringWriter stw.
