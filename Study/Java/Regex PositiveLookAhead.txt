                            ==================



(?=X) X, via zero-width positive lookahead 

Example:  xdot(?=xdot)
          This will match any xdot immediatelly follwed by xdot

Important:   positive lookahead must immdiatelly match from whatever we are looking ahead
             If there are any other searches/conditions, we have to put them in 
             lookahead parentheses.



Example:   String str="yellow.yellow------yellowblue--yellow????yellow>>yellow";
           Pattern ptr=Pattern.compile("(yellow)(?=.*yellow)");
           Matcher mtr = ptr.matcher(str);

           This will match yellow followed by any characters followed by yellow
