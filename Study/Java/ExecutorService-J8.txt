void    shutdown(); // Initiates shutdown, no new tasks accepted

List<Runnable> shutdownNow(); //Attempts to stop all executing tasks, returns list of tasks awaiting execution
Future<T>  submit(Callable<T> task);

This class provides methods to manage termination and methods that can produce a Future for tracking progress 
of one or more asynchronous tasks. 
An ExecutorService can be shut down, which will cause it to reject new tasks.
