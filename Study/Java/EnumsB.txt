enum is a subclass java.lang.Enum
   as such it cannot extend any other class


constructor of enum:  
--------------------
                            
The constructor for an enum type must be package-private or private access. 
It automatically creates the constants that are defined at the beginning of the enum body. 
We cannot invoke an enum constructor yourself. Only via enum constants.


Type

enum colors {RED,GREEN,BLUE}

print(colors.BLACK  instanceof colors);   //will return true
