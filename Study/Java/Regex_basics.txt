                            ==============

Classes Pattern and Matcher are in:  java.util.regex.*


Pattern is the class which accepts regular expression.

Matcher is the class which accepts String to be matched by regex.


Getting Pattern instance:  Pattern pttr=Pattern.compile("a.*b");

Getting Matcher instance:  Matcher mtr = Pattern.matcher("alphabeta");

Did we match:   if(mtr.find()){ ... }


First position of match:          int   mtr.start();
Past last  position of match:     int   mtr.end();
Match expression:               String  mtr.group();
These expressions are for the whole matching sequence, from a  to  b  for this regex.



Matching first group = first left parentheses:

First position of match:          int   mtr.start(1);
Past last  position of match:     int   mtr.end(1);
Match expression:               String  mtr.group(1);
These expressions are for the first group.

We can restart search by giving argument position fo function find:

Did we match:   if(mtr.find(int newStartPosition)){ ... }
