		JSP Implicit Objects
		====================

They can be directly used in scriptlets

pageContext   (instance of PageContext, kind of environment info supply.  
               It is used for accessing page, request, application and session attributes.)

request       The main purpose of request implicit object is to get the data on a JSP page 
              which has been entered by user on the previous JSP page. 
              While dealing with login and signup forms in JSP 
              we often prompts user to fill in those details, 
              this object is then used to get those entered details on an another JSP page (action page) 
              for validation and other purposes.

response      It is basically used for modifying or delaing with the response 
              which is being sent to the client(browser) after processing the request

session      (instance of HttpSession)

config     (instance of ServletConfig: javax.servlet.ServletConfig)
