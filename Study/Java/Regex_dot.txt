                            ===========




The regular expression . matches any character except a line terminator unless the DOTALL flag is specified. 

If I want to match real dot I have to use:  "  \\.  "

Example:  Pattern pr = Pattern.compile(".\\.\\.\\.",Pattern.DOTALL);
--------  ( This will match: some_char... )
